            <h2><strong>SEE NO EVIL</strong></h2>
            <p>I became fascinated with the concept of speak no, see no, hear no evil. And - and the actual depiction of three wise monkeys. And I began collecting it over the years. And I kind of figured that I might be the - the fourth monkey, the feel no evil monkey.</p>

            <h2><strong>SPEAK NO EVIL</strong></h2>
            <p id="speak">It is not so important to be serious as it is to be serious about the important things. The monkey wears an expression of seriousness which would do credit to any college student, but the monkey is serious because he itches.            </p>
